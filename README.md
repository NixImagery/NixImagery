## NixImagery

I am a Doctoral researcher at Moray House. A former professional developer, latterly physics and mathematics teacher, and lecturer, I am a Fellow of the IoP and a Senior Fellow HEA.

There are various repositories here at NixImagery, and other sites containing content I have produced and am continuing to work on.

Feel free to ask me about anything I'm doing, and please do get in touch if we may have something of use to share.
